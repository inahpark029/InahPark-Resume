        <p class="lead mb-4">Medical Scribe for Joshua Clinic-
        Scribed for family medicine and pediatrics with Dr. Banson and Dr. Chi. Working alongside Dr. Banson, I assisted with charts, learned procedure methods, and increased my knowledge of human physiology. In pediatrics with Dr. Chi, I performed routine check-ups, discussed with patients, and was taught the differences between adolescent anatomy versus post pubescent-- both the chemical make-up and physical aspects. Not only have I worked at a medical clinic, but also joined the physicians to a connected hospital to explore other specialties such as neurology, cardiology, oncology, and orthopedics. While they performed surgeries, I shadowed nurses and physicians from ER floors to PICU. I discussed with radiologists and oncologists and learned how to read the scans to detect masses or abnormalities. In the hospital, I observed teamwork between the physicians and nurses and applied that when working in groups. During my time working as a medical scribe, I was able to experience each specialty and enhance my skills of flexibility, responsibility, time management, leadership, and team working.<br><br>

        Intern Paramedic and EMT Training-
        Entered an EMT training program to pursue a career in the medical field as a paramedic, surgeon, or ER physician. Received training to be able to read EKG machines, insert endotracheal intubation, vein access, assess situations, damage control, and CPR. Reading the EKG machine was the most challenging when identifying the differences between V-fib, V-tach, sinus tach, and sinus brady rhythms. Having knowledge of damage control and improving assessing situations prepared me for unexpected cases away from EMT training. Training alongside my colleagues, we performed team exercises to stay grounded under pressure and flexibility with unknown surroundings. I was able to have hands-on experience in an ambulance and follow the paramedics to respond to a few emergency calls. During the emergency calls, I executed the procedures however falter a couple times which taught determination and resistance. Through this training and interning, I learned to have mindful thinking under pressure, stability while executing my emergency knowledge, and adaptability to different environments.<br><br>

        Biochemical Research Assistant-
        Assisted Wendy Ro, a UCSD graduate, for 2 years with biochemical engineering research. Discussed and created different hypotheses for cell and molecular regenerative engineering using cell make-up of lizards and octopuses. Read through research papers for regenerative medicine such as using combinations of skin cells like fish skin used on burn patients. Learned different methods of testing the theories: petri dish, stem cell retrieval, tissue engineering, drug-affected cell mapping, and genome editing. Using trial and error, Ms. Ro and I tested out combinations of methods such as genome editing along with tissue engineering. While she pitched her research to professors and physicians, I took leadership roles directing the other assistants to their lab stations and helping with stem cell procedures and dissections. I also assisted Wendy Ro with pitching the research for funding and received a federal grant along with hospital grants. The research is still continuing but has uncovered more research opportunities for bioengineering regenerative medicine. Assisting Wendy Ro and other researchers in this study shaped my leadership and developed my creative thinking for future experminations.
